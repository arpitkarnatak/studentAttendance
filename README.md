This is a simple Decentralized Application which I created using HTML, web3 and Solidity. You need to download MetaMask extension from Chrome Extension Store to run the Dapp.

1. Install MetaMask. MetaMask allows to connect your web-app to the blockchain. You can connect to either the main ethereum network or some test blockchain. Since we are in the development stages, we'll stick to a test network.

2. Create a wallet. Then select Kovan Test Network. There's an option to Buy ethers. Click on that and follow the procedure to get ethers in your wallet (It is absolutely free to get test ethers. these ethers are test ethers and have no value. So you can't use it in the main ethereum network)

3. Clone the repository. Open index.html. On line number 99, initialize the variable ad with the address where the contract is deployed. To get the address, go to https://remix.ethereum.org/ and deploy your smart contract. Choose the deployment environment as Injected Web3. Once you click deploy, the contract would be created. Go to deployed contracts and copy the address and paste it to variable ad.

4. Run the live server. Connect the metamask to the website. To do that, click the 3 dots next to your account in the metamask window > connected sites > manually connect current site > Connect > Connect and you are connected to the test blockchain network.

5. Enter a name and click the plus sign. A metamask alert would pop-up. Confirm it and wait for a while. There would be a transaction successful notification and the name would be added to the list.


NOTE : It would take about 30-40 seconds because the block is being mined.
